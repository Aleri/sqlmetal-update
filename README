#SQLMetal update utility

This little aplication was created simply because I had some problems with updating entities via SQLMetal. 

Namely I have a specific constructor I want in the context and using SQLMetal wipes it every time.

Nothing much to it really, a companion utility to the standard .bat script usage of SQLMetal.
